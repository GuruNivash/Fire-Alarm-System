The primary purpose of the fire alarm system is to provide an early warning of fire so that people can be evacuated & immediate action can be taken to stop or eliminate the fire as soon as possible. These alarms is activated automatically from smoke detectors and temperature sensors.  The temperature sensor is utilized as a part of the Fire Alarm System to recognize a fire. The temperature sensor records the temperature of the room. If the room temperature reaches a certain threshold - fire threat is detected, the designed fire alarm system gets automatically activated and alerts the user by three mechanisms: a countdown timer, an alarm and the glow of a bright red LED. 
An efficient design of a fire alarm system using Verilog and a possible solution where the user controls the device by employing a central Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) controller to which the devices and sensors are interfaced. The FPGA can meet the needs of high-speed real-time with its hardware features.
